NASA is poised to enhance our understanding of the cosmos with the upcoming launch of two innovative missions: SPHEREx and PUNCH. Scheduled for March 9, 2025, at 03:09 UTC (March 8, 2025, 7:09 PM PST), these missions will be carried into space aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Vandenberg Space Force Base.

### **SPHEREx: Mapping the Infrared Universe**

SPHEREx, short for **Spectro-Photometer for the History of the Universe, Epoch of Reionization, and Ices Explorer**, is a near-infrared space observatory designed to conduct an all-sky survey. Its primary objectives include investigating cosmic inflation—the rapid expansion of the universe after the Big Bang—and searching for water and organic molecules in the Milky Way. By measuring the spectra of approximately 450 million galaxies, SPHEREx aims to create a comprehensive 3D map of the universe in 102 near-infrared colors. This extensive mapping will provide insights into the distribution of galaxies and the conditions that led to the formation of stars and galaxies.

### **PUNCH: Unraveling Solar Wind Mysteries**

PUNCH, which stands for **Polarimeter to Unify the Corona and Heliosphere**, consists of four microsatellites that will study the Sun's outer corona and the solar wind. The mission seeks to understand how the Sun's corona transitions into the solar wind—a stream of charged particles emitted by the Sun that affects space weather and can impact satellite operations and communications on Earth. By observing the solar wind's formation and evolution, PUNCH aims to improve our ability to predict space weather events, thereby safeguarding technological infrastructure.

### **Comparison with the James Webb Space Telescope**

While SPHEREx and PUNCH are specialized missions targeting specific scientific objectives, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) serves as a versatile, high-resolution observatory for detailed studies of the universe. JWST, launched in December 2021, has a 6.5-meter primary mirror and is designed for high-resolution imaging and spectroscopy across the infrared spectrum. Its mission encompasses a broad range of astrophysical phenomena, from observing the most distant galaxies to studying the formation of stars and planets. In contrast, SPHEREx focuses on spectroscopic mapping of the cosmos, and PUNCH investigates solar wind dynamics.

### **Anticipated Impact and Future Prospects**

The data collected by SPHEREx and PUNCH will complement the observations made by JWST, offering a more comprehensive understanding of both the distant universe and our own solar environment. By addressing fundamental questions about the origins of the universe and the behavior of solar phenomena, these missions exemplify NASA's commitment to advancing space exploration and scientific discovery.

As the launch date approaches, the scientific community eagerly anticipates the wealth of information these missions are expected to provide, paving the way for future research and exploration endeavors.
