On March 11, 2025, at 11:10 p.m. EST (0310 GMT on March 12), NASA successfully launched the SPHEREx observatory and the PUNCH mission aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California.

### Launch Vehicle and Preparations

The Falcon 9 Block 5 rocket, renowned for its reliability and reusability, was selected for this mission. In the days leading up to the launch, both NASA and SpaceX teams conducted thorough checks to ensure all systems were operational. A prelaunch news briefing was held on March 5, where mission details and objectives were discussed. 

### Countdown and Liftoff

As the countdown progressed on March 11, the Falcon 9's autonomous internal flight computers took control, initiating the final prelaunch sequences. At T-minus zero, the rocket's nine Merlin engines ignited, producing a thrust of over 1.7 million pounds. The Falcon 9 lifted off smoothly from Space Launch Complex 4E, illuminating the night sky over California.

### Stage Separation and Payload Deployment

Approximately two and a half minutes into the flight, the first stage engines shut down, and stage separation occurred. The second stage's single Merlin Vacuum engine then ignited, continuing the journey to orbit. The first stage executed a controlled descent back to Earth, successfully landing on SpaceX's drone ship stationed in the Pacific Ocean, marking another milestone in reusable rocketry.

Once in the designated orbit, the SPHEREx observatory was deployed first, followed by the release of the four PUNCH satellites. Each satellite's deployment was confirmed through telemetry data, indicating successful separation and the beginning of their respective missions. 

### Mission Objectives

- SPHEREx (Spectro-Photometer for the History of the Universe, Epoch of Reionization, and Ices Explorer): This mission aims to conduct an all-sky survey in the near-infrared spectrum, collecting data on over 450 million galaxies and more than 100 million stars. The objective is to create a 3D map of the universe in 102 light wavelengths, enhancing our understanding of cosmic phenomena such as galaxy formation and evolution. 

- PUNCH (Polarimeter to Unify the Corona and Heliosphere): Consisting of four microsatellites, PUNCH is designed to study the Sun's corona and the solar wind. By observing how the corona transitions into the solar wind, PUNCH aims to improve our understanding of space weather events that can impact Earth's technology and astronauts. 

### Post-Launch Status

Following deployment, initial checks indicated that both SPHEREx and PUNCH satellites were functioning nominally. Over the coming weeks, mission teams will calibrate the instruments and begin the data collection phase, marking the start of a new chapter in space exploration and our understanding of the universe.
